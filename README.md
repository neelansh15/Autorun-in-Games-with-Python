# Autorun-in-Games-with-Python
Run this script and keep it open. When playing a game, press n to autorun with the UP arrow key and m to stop. You can also stop by pressing the UP key again :)  I originally made this for the online MMO game Tankionline, but it can be used for any game using arrow keys. You can also change the keys :)
